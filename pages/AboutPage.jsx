                <div className="about-flex">
                <p>Tamir is what developers call a New Promise! he is only 20 years old, yet he can show even your mama how to make a gmail from scratch!
                    he likes burgers and working with Eran Houja on various projects such as this one. 
                    He lives in Rehovot, Israel, he likes diving and Thai wrestling, and he also really looks like the old version of superman, the one with Christopher Reeve!

                <h3>About Eran Houja</h3>
                <div className="about-flex">
                <p>Eran is what developers would call an unfulfilled promise! a promise.catch if you'd like. he is mostly a talented musician, yet for some strange reason he somehow tries to also learn code,
                    luckily he has Tamir Leshetz on his side and together they can even make google try to search after them. Eran has lived all over the world, yet he is now unemplyed and looking for a nice break!
                    He enjoyed doing this notes project, and will continue writing notes to himself with this app, someday maybe his notes will be fulfilled.
